ideas:
- add 2 crops, show the end result
- tweak individual values, show the crops that meet those specifications
- implement ranging - suggest closest combination based on user's inputs
- add a search fn for the 2 dropdowns instead of just click to dropdown
- add some filters to the reference table
- add a bookmarked section - save options to local storage
- do a future export and import of json
