ideas:
- add 2 crops, show the end result
- tweak individual values, show the crops that meet those specifications
- implement ranging - suggest closest combination based on user's inputs
- add a search fn for the 2 dropdowns instead of just click to dropdown
- add some filters to the reference table
- add a bookmarked section - save options to local storage
- do a future export and import of json

- add history of combinations in local storage with clearing fn

- need to apply ferterlizer - need to check the stats for that

sections:
- maybe default is the dropdown section, but if user wants to use and define traits to get the crop, they can also do so by toggling another section
